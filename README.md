# ImageSearchApp

This Image Search App allows users to search for high-quality images from the Unsplash API. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app provides a simple and intuitive interface where users can type in a search term, and the app will display relevant images in a responsive grid layout. Each image, when clicked, triggers a smooth transition effect that reveals an overlay with the image description and additional details, enhancing the user experience. The application dynamically fetches images using the Unsplash API based on the search query. The layout is fully responsive, ensuring seamless use on both desktop and mobile devices. Users can view the full-size image and its description, offering both visual and informational value. The app requires an API key from Unsplash, which can be easily added to the JavaScript file for functionality.
